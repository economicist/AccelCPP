This program needs to read the input an entire line at a time. Fortunately, the
string library provides what we need in the getline function, which reads input
until it reaches the end of the line. The getline function takes two arguments.
The first is the istream from which to read; the second is a reference to the
string into which to store what is read. As usual, the getline function returns
a reference to the istream from which we read, so that we can test that istream
in a condition. If we hit end-of-file or encounter invalid input, then the
return from getline will indicate failure and we'll break out of the while.

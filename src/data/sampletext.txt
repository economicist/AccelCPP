Suppose we wish to find the median of a collection of values Assume that we have read some of the values so far and that we have no idea how many values remain to be read Prove that we cannot afford to discard any of the values that we have read Hint One proof strategy is to assume that we can discard a value and then find values for the unread and therefore unknown part of our collection that would cause the median to be the value that we discarded
